M: What's this cave?
G: Old mine... not used for 30 years.
M: Why don't you use it?
G: Monsters have infested there and there are no mine supports, from my father's stories I heard that it is quite rich in minerals
M: Maybe we could adapt it?
G: We can try. Help me rebuild the mine, and I'll repay you in minerals


M: How is the rebuilding of the mine going?
G: We're on the right track, but an extra pair of hands will be useful. Got a moment off?



G: What do you need?
M: Extra minerals is always useful...
