M: Why are you standing here alone?
A: As archers we don't have any other place to practice our bow skills. Here was an armory but it was burned by monsters
M: Tell me what to do and we'll build new armory for you


A: We did a great job but to finish building we need more materials
M: I'll do what it takes 



A: Welcome in our armory. How could i help you?
M: We'll see what you could do for me.
